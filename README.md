##  SQL Cheat-Sheet (for reviewers)


**1. Gender-wise revenue**

            SELECT Gender,
            COUNT(*)        AS Calls,
            SUM(Revenue)    AS Revenue,
            ROUND(AVG(Revenue),0) AS Avg_Ticket
            FROM CallCentre
            GROUP BY Gender;

**2. Agent performance**

           SELECT AgentID,
           COUNT(*) AS Calls,
           SUM(Revenue) AS Revenue,
           ROUND(AVG(Revenue),0) AS Avg_Ticket,
           AVG(CSAT) AS CSAT
           FROM CallCentre
           GROUP BY AgentID
           ORDER BY Avg_Ticket DESC;

**Closing Note**

Every call is a revenue moment. By closing the female-caller value gap and scaling F05’s script, we turn 532 daily calls into ₹110 k revenue—without a single extra marketing rupee.
